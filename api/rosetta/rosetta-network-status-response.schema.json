It is assumed that any BlockIdentifier.Index less than or equal to CurrentBlockIdentifier.Index can be queried. If a Rosetta implementation prunes historical state, it should populate the optional oldest_block_identifier field with the oldest block available to query. If this is not populated, it is assumed that the genesis_block_identifier is the oldest queryable block. If a Rosetta implementation performs some pre-sync before it is possible to query blocks, sync_status should be populated so that clients can still monitor healthiness. Without this field, it may appear that the implementation is stuck syncing and needs to be terminated.","required":["current_block_identifier","current_block_timestamp","genesis_block_identifier","peers"],"properties":{"current_block_identifier":{"$id":"rosetta-block-identifier.schema.json","title":"RosettaBlockIdentifier","description":"The block_identifier uniquely identifies a block in a particular network.","allOf":[{"required":["hash"],"$id":"rosetta-block-identifier-hash.schema.json","type":"object","title":"RosettaBlockIdentifierHash","description":"This is also known as the block hash.","properties":{"hash":{"type":"string","description":"This is also known as the block hash."}}},{"required":["index"],"$id":"rosetta-block-identifier-height.schema.json","type":"object","title":"RosettaBlockIdentifierHeight","description":"This is also known as the block height.","properties":{"index":{"type":"integer","description":"This is also known as the block height."}}}]},"current_block_timestamp":{"type":"integer","description":"The timestamp of the block in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch.
